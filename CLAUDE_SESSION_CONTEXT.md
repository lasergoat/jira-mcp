# Claude Code Session Context - Jira MCP Enhancement

## Problem Solved
The jira-mcp had a fundamental design flaw where it only discovered a hardcoded subset of ~8 fields, missing standard Jira fields like `labels`, `priority`, `assignee`, etc. When users tried to update these fields, they got "field not supported" errors.

## Root Cause
- The `configure-project-fields` function only looked for hardcoded field patterns
- The `update-ticket` tool had hardcoded parameters instead of being dynamic
- Standard Jira fields like `labels` were never discovered or configured

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Field Discovery (`src/config/discovery.ts`)
- **Modified `discoverProjectFields` method** to accept `fieldsToDiscover` parameter
- **Added logic** to return ALL available fields when no specific fields requested (lines 198-217)
- **Made field discovery comprehensive** instead of limited to hardcoded patterns
- Now the LLM can see all available fields and choose which ones to configure

### 2. Updated Configure Tool (`src/config/tools.ts`)
- **Updated line 49-55** to pass `fields_to_discover` parameter to discovery function
- Tool now supports discovering specific fields OR all available fields

### 3. Enhanced Update Ticket Tool (`src/jira/tools.ts`)
- **Completely rewrote update-ticket tool** (lines 604-731) to be fully dynamic
- **Added support for standard Jira fields**: labels, priority, assignee, components, environment
- **Added custom_fields parameter** for any configured field
- **Removed hardcoded field handling** - now resolves fields dynamically through configuration

### 4. Improved Ticket Display (`src/jira/tools.ts`)
- **Fixed formatting issues** in get-ticket output (lines 471-514)
- **Added proper line breaks** and field labels
- **Clean display format** instead of raw JSON dump

## Current Status
- ✅ Code changes completed and built successfully (`npm run build` passed)
- ✅ Field discovery now supports ALL available fields instead of hardcoded subset
- ✅ Update-ticket tool now dynamic and supports any configured field
- ⏳ **Need to restart Claude Code** to pick up the enhanced MCP functionality

## Next Steps After Restart
1. Test enhanced field discovery: `configure-project-fields` with fields like `["labels", "priority", "assignee"]`
2. Verify VIP project can now discover standard Jira fields
3. Test updating a ticket with labels using the enhanced `update-ticket` tool

## Key Files Modified
- `/Users/danielwalker/Projects/jira-mcp/src/config/discovery.ts` - Field discovery logic
- `/Users/danielwalker/Projects/jira-mcp/src/config/tools.ts` - Configure project fields tool
- `/Users/danielwalker/Projects/jira-mcp/src/jira/tools.ts` - Update ticket tool and get ticket formatting

## The Solution
Instead of hardcoding field knowledge in the MCP, we made it **field-agnostic**. The MCP now discovers ALL available fields and lets the LLM choose which ones to configure based on user needs. This makes the MCP much more flexible and supports the full range of Jira functionality.

## Test Commands to Run After Restart
```
# Test enhanced field discovery
mcp__jira-mcp__configure-project-fields project_key="VIP" fields_to_discover=["labels", "priority", "assignee", "components"]

# Test enhanced ticket display
mcp__jira-mcp__get-ticket ticket_id="VIP-48"

# Test updating a ticket with labels (once labels are configured)
mcp__jira-mcp__update-ticket ticket_id="VIP-48" labels=["bug", "urgent"]
```
